# Mousetrap plug-ins for OpenSesame
The Mousetrap package provides two plug-ins that implement mouse-tracking in [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/):
the `mousetrap_form` and the `mousetrap_response` plug-in.

Both plug-ins offer different ways of implementing mouse-tracking, depending on how the stimulus display is designed.
More information about each plug-in can be found in the corresponding helpfile:
* Information about [mousetrap_response plug-in](mousetrap_response/mousetrap_response.md)
* Information about [mousetrap_form plug-in](mousetrap_form/mousetrap_form.md)

## Installation
To install the plug-ins, you can download the repository from the GitHub site (e.g., by clicking on "Download ZIP" on the right side).
Once downloaded, the plug-ins can be installed by copying them into one of the folders that OpenSesame searches for plug-ins
(e.g., under Windows the "plugins" folder in the OpenSesame installation directory). 
More information about installing plug-ins can be found on the [OpenSesame homepage](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/plug-ins/installation/).
