The Mousetrap package provides two plug-ins that implement mouse-tracking in [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/).
Both plug-ins offer different ways of implementing mouse-tracking:

![alt text](plugins/mousetrap_response/mousetrap_response_large.png "mousetrap_response plug-in") The [mousetrap_response plug-in](plugins/mousetrap_response/mousetrap_response.md) tracks mouse movements while another stimulus (e.g., a sketchpad) is presented.

![alt text](plugins/mousetrap_form/mousetrap_form_large.png "mousetrap_form plug-in") The [mousetrap_form plug-in](plugins/mousetrap_form/mousetrap_form.md) allows tracking of mouse movements in custom forms specified using OpenSesame script.

More information about each plug-in can be found in the corresponding helpfiles (as linked above).
Besides, a number of example experiments that demonstrate the basic features of the plug-ins can be found in the [examples folder](examples).

Once data have been collected with the plug-ins, the data can be processed, analyzed and visualized using the [mousetrap R package](https://github.com/PascalKieslich/mousetrap).


## General information

## Installation

### Latest stable version

To install the latest release, please run the following commands in OpenSesame's [debug window](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/manual/interface/#the-debug-window):

```python
import pip
pip.main(['install', 'https://github.com/PascalKieslich/mousetrap-os/archive/stable.zip'])
```

You'll need to restart OpenSesame after the installation for the plug-ins to work.

If the installation fails due to missing write access, you may have to run OpenSesame with administrator privileges for the installation (on Windows, right-click the OpenSesame program icon and select [Run as Administrator](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732200.aspx)).

The [installation of plug-ins](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/manual/environment/#installing-plugins-and-extensions) is covered in more detail in the OpenSesame documentation, which also covers alternate methods. To install the plug-ins manually, please download the archive attached to the [latest release](https://github.com/PascalKieslich/mousetrap-os/releases/latest)

[Release notes for the latest version](https://github.com/PascalKieslich/mousetrap-os/releases/latest) are available, as for all [previous releases](https://github.com/PascalKieslich/mousetrap-os/releases).

### Development version

To install the latest development version, please follow the above instructions, replacing the command with the following:

```python
import pip
pip.main(['install', 'https://github.com/PascalKieslich/mousetrap-os/archive/master.zip'])
